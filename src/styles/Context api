Context Api is a part of react which is used to manage yhe state state. To overcome the problem of props drilling we use redux.

What is Props Drilling?
Props drilling means passing the data from parent component to the nested child components.
suppose we have nested component A , B , C , D, E , F and we have to pass
the data from parent component A to the nested child component F.Without state management library we first pass the data to B then to C then to D then to E and finally to F

Can we pass the data from child component to parent component?
Yes , we can pass as a callback function but I have not done that yet.I know the concept but I have not utilize that yet.

To solve the props drilling issue we use context api to manage our state.
